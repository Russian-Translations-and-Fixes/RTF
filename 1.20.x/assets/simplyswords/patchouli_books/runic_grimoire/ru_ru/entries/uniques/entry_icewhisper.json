      "text": "In addition to its chilling presence, the halberd also has the ability to summon a blizzard, enveloping the battlefield in a tempest of ice and snow. This blizzard not only deals damage to foes, but also makes it harder for them to see and move, providing the wielder with a tactical advantage. The halberd is said to be forged from the purest ice and it shimmers with a cool blue light."
